source code for lab 4
README
two logs from part 1 and part 2


this lab was written for edisont intel kit with grove tempreture sensor.

part 1 is running the program for 1 in and collect temperture and write it in

to file, i used mraa library to connect to tempereture and get the temp.

part2 will connect to server and collect the port number that was created for

each student. then will recive the commands from server and respond to it and

log it into a file, the program was wrriten by multithreading.

important note was that server was keep going down and program should have

checked if the server is down or not , getting the right port as an integer is 
improtant too. i need to flush this kit one time due to the os issue of my
windows laptop.
